# Find the Highest Altitude

##  Problem Statement
There is a biker going on a road trip consisting of `n + 1` points.  
The biker starts at **altitude 0**.  
You are given an integer array `gain` of length `n`, where `gain[i]` is the net gain in altitude between points `i` and `i + 1`.  

Return the **highest altitude** reached during the trip.

---

##  Approach
- Initialize:
  - `sum = 0` → current altitude.  
  - `max = 0` → highest altitude seen so far.  
- Iterate through the array:
  - Add `gain[i]` to `sum` (update current altitude).  
  - Update `max = Math.max(max, sum)` to track the maximum altitude.  
- Return `max` after the loop.

---

##  Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` → single traversal of the array.  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` → only two variables used.

# Pivot Index

## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the **pivot index**.  
The **pivot index** is the index where the sum of the numbers **to the left** of the index is equal to the sum of the numbers **to the right** of the index.

- If multiple pivot indexes exist, return the **leftmost** one.
- If no pivot index exists, return `-1`.

---

## Approach
1. Compute the **total sum** of the array (`tsum`).  
2. Initialize a variable `lsum = 0` (left sum).  
3. Traverse the array:
   - At index `i`, check if  
     ```
     lsum == tsum - lsum - nums[i]
     ```
     - If true → return `i` (pivot index).  
   - Otherwise, update `lsum += nums[i]`.  
4. If no such index is found, return `-1`.

---

## Time Complexity
- **O(n)** → One pass to calculate total sum, one pass to find pivot index.

## Space Complexity
- **O(1)** → Uses only constant extra space.
